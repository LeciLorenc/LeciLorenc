# 🌍 Hey there, I’m Lorenc 👋  

✨ *Engineer · Explorer · Cybersecurity Adventurer* ✨  

I’m a **Software Engineer** from Milan 🇮🇹 with international escapades in the **USA, Spain, and Colombia**.  
I love mixing **software engineering, AI, and cybersecurity** to create things that are both smart and *“please don’t hack me”* secure.  

⚡ Fun facts about me:  
- When I’m not coding, I’m probably running 🏃‍♂️ like I’m being chased by bugs.  
- Learning new languages and cultures 🌐 is my cardio.  
- Breaking things on purpose 🔐 counts as exercise, right?
